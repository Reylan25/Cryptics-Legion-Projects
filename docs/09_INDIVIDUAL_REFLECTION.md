# Individual Reflection

## 👨‍💻 Reynaldo Reyes (Reylan25)

My experience as a Product Lead and Lead Developer at Cryptics Legion has been a transformative experience. My beginnings with establishing a vision of a local-first expense tracker have seen me grow immensely in terms of cross-platform architecture and database design. The most significant lesson was the importance of prioritizing ruthlessly, as I originally intended to work with cloud sync, AI categorization, and cryptocurrency support simultaneously, yet I found more straightforward and focused features to be much more beneficial to users. Creating the real-world features also meant that I could not make design choices based on assumptions but on real world data. I learned that security, testing, and documentation cannot be considered an afterthought, but they determine the whole code base. The highlight of my life is the multi-currency system which has been integrated with real-time API integration, displaying mature engineering. These are several things that I would do differently had I known to start over first. But most importantly, I came to understand that consistency is greater than intensity, small little commitments daily and community cooperation will go a longer way than individual genius. This self-led concept into group undertaking has equipped me with the idea of developing scalable systems with groups.

I served as a Data & Integration Engineer and worked on scaling our database and enhancing its work. The experience of working with SQLite taught me that real data is much more important than conjectures during optimization. Introduction of exchange rate caching demonstrated that the quality of data and speed can not be separated. One of the highlights was to design a storage architecture which would be interoperable across platforms. Reflectively, I would have conducted performance testing sooner than responding later. Working with Reylan and rogxz-14 demonstrated that backend engineering does not only assist in making the system efficient but also the entire product. One thing was laid bare in this work and that is that solid data foundation is the only way to build solid products.

In the forefront position of UI/UX and QA has been ample. The fact that technical requirements in both the mobile 390x844 and desktop 1920x1080 were designed to accommodate responsiveness led me to accept responsive restrictions as design capabilities rather than design limitations. Cross-platform testing revealed UX problems that can never be found through code reviews such as the currency dropdown bug that users found but had not been captured by metrics. My best accomplishment is my ability to design a complete design system which makes it easy to prototype features quickly and at the same time keeps up its consistency. First, I undervalued the importance of UI polish dimensions such as the gradient backgrounds and section badges, which made the app look more of less a utility than an enjoyable experience. Working on architecture with Reylan and data validation with Itscrl showed me that a hugely successful UX needs knowledge of the backend. The next thing I would encourage were mobile-first and user testing sooner. The largest lesson: except users usually find applications in ways the engineers had never thought of the feedback loops come in at any cost.
