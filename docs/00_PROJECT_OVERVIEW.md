# Cryptics Legion - Smart Expense Tracker

## Project Overview

**Cryptics Labs** is a cross-platform smart expense tracker built with Flet (Flutter for Python). It enables users to manage their finances through multi-account support, real-time multi-currency tracking, and data-driven spending insights. The application integrates secure authentication, offline functionality, and detailed analytics to help users monitor expenses and understand their financial habits across devices.

Many users find it difficult to maintain consistent and accurate records of their expenses, especially when dealing with multiple currencies, various payment methods, and scattered financial data. Existing tools often lack deep analytics, secure storage, and flexible access across platforms. As a result, users struggle to gain clear insights into their spending behavior and make informed financial decisions.

Cryptics Legion addresses this by offering a secure, intuitive, and analytics-driven expense management platform that unifies multi-currency tracking, account management, and financial reporting in one system.
